### Features

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
Input validation to ensure numeric values are entered
Error handling for division by zero
User-friendly interface with clear instructions
Option to exit anytime by pressing 'q'

### How to Use

Run the script in a Python environment.
Select an operation by entering the corresponding number:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
Enter two numbers when prompted.
The result will be displayed.
To exit, enter 'q' instead of an operation number.

### Requirements

Python 3.x


## Password Generator

### Description:- This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on the specified length. It uses uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create strong and secure passwords.

### How It Works

The script imports the random and string modules.
The generate_password() function creates a password by randomly selecting characters from:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!@#$%^&* etc.)
The main() function asks the user to enter the desired password length.
If the length is less than 4, an error message is displayed.
Otherwise, a random password is generated and printed.

### How to Use

Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the desired password length (minimum 4).
The generated password will be displayed.
