## TASK_2

## Simple Calculator

Description: This is a basic Python calculator that performs four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop, allowing users to choose operations until they decide to quit. It also handles invalid inputs and prevents division by zero.

### Features

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
Input validation to ensure numeric values are entered
Error handling for division by zero
User-friendly interface with clear instructions
Option to exit anytime by pressing 'q'

### How to Use

Run the script in a Python environment.
Select an operation by entering the corresponding number:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
Enter two numbers when prompted.
The result will be displayed.
To exit, enter 'q' instead of an operation number.

### Requirements

Python 3.x

## TASK_3 

## Password Generator

Description:- This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on the specified length. It uses uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create strong and secure passwords.

### How It Works

The script imports the random and string modules.
The generate_password() function creates a password by randomly selecting characters from:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Digits (0-9)
Special characters (!@#$%^&* etc.)
The main() function asks the user to enter the desired password length.
If the length is less than 4, an error message is displayed.
Otherwise, a random password is generated and printed.

### How to Use

Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter the desired password length (minimum 4).
The generated password will be displayed.


## TASK_4

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in Python. You can play against the computer and keep track of the score.

### How to Play

Run the script.
Choose rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.
The computer will randomly pick one of the three options.
The winner is decided based on the rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
Your score and the computer's score are updated after each round.
To quit, type 'q' when asked for input.

### Requirements

Python 3.x
No additional libraries needed (uses only the built-in random module).
